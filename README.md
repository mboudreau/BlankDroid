BlankDroid - A Blank Android Project with Maven, Holoeverywhere & RoboGuice
==================================================

While I was trying my hand at Android development, I find a surprising lack of simple blank projects to base myself on.  I did find some, but they were inadequate for my purposes as I wanted other features like Maven integration, the ability to keep the same look and feel using HoloEverywhere and a simple way to use dependency injection to easily manage classes.

I couldn't find any examples that had all of these, so I made one.

This is currently based on the HoloEverywhere Demo project but with added RoboGuice injection (not yet done).  I hope that this project helps the next person trying to get into Android development.
